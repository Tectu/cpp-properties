# Properties
Properties are what this library is all about. There are a number of property types available to ensure maximum flexiblity:
- **[Raw properties](./raw_properties.md)**: This is the most common form of a property. Use this if you want to use a regular member variable as a property.
- **[Linked properties](./linked_properties.md)**: Linked properties are used when public or protected member variables of a base class should become properties.
- **[Linked property functions](./linked_property_functions.md)**: Allows to use private members variables of a base class as properties.
